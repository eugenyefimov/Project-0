## Overview
This architecture implements a highly available, fault-tolerant infrastructure across multiple AWS regions using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Terraform. The design ensures business continuity through geographic redundancy, automated failover mechanisms, and consistent deployment practices.

## Design Principles
1. High Availability : Distributed across multiple regions and availability zones
2. Fault Tolerance : Automatic failover between regions during outages
3. Scalability : Dynamic resource allocation based on demand
4. Security : Defense in depth with multiple security layers
5. Infrastructure as Code : Consistent, version-controlled infrastructure
6. Automation : CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure and application deployment
7. Cost Optimization : Right-sized resources with auto-scaling capabilities
8. Operational Excellence : Streamlined operations with monitoring and automation
9. Performance Efficiency : Optimized resource utilization and response times

## Components

### Primary and Secondary Regions
The infrastructure is deployed across two AWS regions:

- Primary Region : us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
- Secondary Region : us-west-2 (Oregon)
Each region contains identical infrastructure components to ensure seamless failover with minimal data loss and downtime.

### Networking
- VPC : Each region has a dedicated Virtual Private Cloud with non-overlapping CIDR blocks
  
  - Primary: 10.0.0.0/16
  - Secondary: 10.1.0.0/16
  - Subnets : Each VPC contains multiple subnets across availability zones
  
  - Public Subnets : Host load balancers and NAT gateways
  - Private Subnets : Host application servers and other protected resources
  - Internet Gateway : Provides internet access for resources in public subnets
  - NAT Gateway : Enables outbound internet access for resources in private subnets while maintaining security
  - Route Tables : Define traffic paths between subnets, the internet, and other AWS services
  - VPC Flow Logs : Network traffic monitoring
  
  - Capture rejected traffic
  - 30-day retention in CloudWatch Logs
  - Integration with Athena for analysis
  - Transit Gateway : Simplifies network architecture by connecting VPCs and on-premises networks
  
  - Centralized routing
  - Cross-region peering
  - Simplified security management

### Compute
  - EC2 Instances : Host application workloads in private subnets for enhanced security
  - Auto Scaling Groups : Automatically adjust capacity based on:
  
  - CPU utilization (scale up at 80%, down at 20%)
  - Network traffic patterns

  - Health Checks : Monitor the availability of resources in each region
  
  - HTTPS checks on port 443
  - 30-second intervals
  - 3 consecutive failures trigger failover
- Failover Routing : Automatically route traffic to the secondary region if the primary region fails

### Database
  - DynamoDB Global Tables : Multi-region, multi-master database with automatic replication
  
  - Consistent data access across regions
  - Automatic conflict resolution
  - Point-in-time recovery enabled
  - Auto Scaling : Automatically adjust read and write capacity based on demand
  
  - Target utilization: 70%
  - Min capacity: 1
  - Max capacity: 10
  - DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) : In-memory cache for DynamoDB
  
  - Microsecond response times for read-heavy workloads
  - No application code changes required
  - Deployed in multiple AZs for high availability

### Content Delivery
  - S3 : Store static content with:
  - Versioning enabled
  - Server-side encryption (AES-256)
  - Public access blocked
  - Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
  - CloudFront : Global content delivery network for faster access to static content

## Disaster Recovery Strategy
The architecture implements a warm standby disaster recovery model with the following characteristics:

1. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) : < 15 minutes
2. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) : < 5 minutes
3. Disaster Recovery Testing : Scheduled quarterly failover drills
4. Backup Strategy :
   - Daily automated backups
   - Cross-region backup replication
   - 30-day retention policy
5. Restoration Procedures :
   - Documented runbooks for different failure scenarios
   - Automated recovery scripts
   - Regular restoration testing

## Failover Mechanism
In the event of a primary region failure:

1. Route53 health checks detect the failure within 90 seconds
2. Failover routing policy automatically routes traffic to the secondary region
3. DynamoDB Global Tables ensure data consistency across regions with minimal replication lag
4. CloudFront continues to serve static content from the nearest edge location
5. Application instances in the secondary region handle all traffic
6. When the primary region recovers, traffic can be manually or automatically shifted back
This architecture ensures minimal downtime and data loss during regional failures, providing a robust solution for business-critical applications.
